Examples for repair_dos_eps(): [Future]
------------------------------

Multiple formats - Multiple Inclusions [Photoshop + TIFF]
----------------

This file is originally identified as [dos_eps]. Cleaned up
with repair_dos_eps() (fixed), identified as [postscript], 
then cleaned upwith unmacify() and atrip_preview(). 

Too Complicated for simple strip_preview() tests! Reserve example
for dos_repair_eps() -> unmacify() -> strip_preview() cleanup.

From source.log:
